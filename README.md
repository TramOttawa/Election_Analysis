## 3. Election-Audit Summary: 

The script used in this analyis is very useful and efficient. It can be used for many times with the same election level using the same script but changing the source of the dataset only.

It can be used for the other scales of elections, such as State elections or even for Federal elections. In that case, the variables need to be modified accordingly such as changing from "county" to "State".
